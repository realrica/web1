<h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
<p>
This book is a tutorial. It aims to help you gradually learn the language. But once you’re familiar with the basics, you’ll need other sources.

</p>
<p style="margin-top:40px;>">



  <a href="https://javascript.info/manuals-specifications" target="_blank" title="JAVA script  specification">The ECMA-262 specification</a> contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.

But being that formalized, it’s difficult to understand at first. So if you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place. But it’s not for everyday use.

A new specification version is released every year. In-between these releases, the latest specification draft is at https://tc39.es/ecma262/.

To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are “almost standard” (so-called “stage 3”), see proposals at https://github.com/tc39/proposals.

Also, if you’re in developing for the browser, then there are other specs covered in the second part of the tutorial.
